<h1>Portfolio Website </h1>

   This is my portfolio/resume website
   It took me about a few weeks to build although most of my time went to learning how to code efficiently
   I got taught a lot via this experience
   I did a lot of fault finding via building this website and searching on the internet

## My Bio:
Hi! My name is Morn√© Cornelius. I have had a
computer since age 3 and have always been fascinated by tech, I
started with gaming, but soon became interested in software
and programming works. Most of what I know I taught myself. I
have learned that when I'm faced with a computer relaproblem
I can always find a solution to fix it. I never leave problems
unresolved. I started learning coding when I was 12 recently
decided to focus on JavaScript. I am still new to the software
development process, but I believe that I am capablelearning
and growing as a developer on the job.

I used a library called [Material UI v5](mui.com) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Material%20UI-007FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=mui&logoColor=white"/>

With the help of the MUI website it explained exactly how every of their components work

## I used it to

   - Make my website responsive using Grids
   - Create a light and dark mode using a set of 2 palettes
   - Resize components and the color of the text
   - Customization of the body
   - I did most of the styling with MUI but did a small amount of touch-ups with CSS

## I used two APIs while building this website:

 - [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    - Used to fetch city's weather info (Degrees, Humididty, Description with Icon)
    - I used [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI) to teach me how this API works

 - [Aerodatabox](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox/)
    - I used this API to track Elon Musk's Private Jet 
      -[Here is proof of the information I am fetching](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a835af)
    - I experimented with the use of this API by using [Globe ADSB exchange](globe.adsbexchange.com) and tracking aircrafts

## What I learnt via this experience:

- Using the build-in terminal in my IDE
- Using Git, node and WSL console command I modified
   - Git push and pull
- I learnt the importance of the order in code and how it works
- Using the browser developer console to edit my website live 
- How to use React hooks and implement it into my code
- Setting up domain and making my code live
- Implementing public APIs via [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
- Implementing a Firebase Projects and managing it via the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuaiXBhCCARIsAKZLt3k49fHYwk9FB_AGm033bEqzQTrxlTeEUSHd__Kd-uO7JCJ5WBWPK4MaAneIEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Functions in this project: 
- A Home function returning all values and UI
- A function displaying of my current live age
- A function searching, retrieving and displaying API data
- A typing effect turning a variable true and false every few miliseconds creating a flickering effect
- An app function returning all the firebase chat data and components
- A sign into google function remembering your chat data
- A sign out of google function
- A chatroom function containing all data stored on the database
- A chat message function allowing users to display user profile
